# CustomerChurn_Analysis
Final Project for BANA 4080 at UC's Linder College of Business. Completed as a solo pursuit.

# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes customer data from a fictional telecom company to identify key drivers of churn and develop predictive models for customer retention. It serves as the final project for a university Data Mining course and was completed independently.

## Key Questions
- What are the strongest predictors of customer churn?
- How do different machine learning models compare in predictive power?
- What business actions can reduce customer loss?

## Key Insights
- **Contract Pricing, Payment Method, and Lack of Phone Service** were key churn indicators.
- **MARS** achieved the best overall performance, with strong feature importance clarity.
- Churn risk is highest among **Higher Pricing Tiers and E Check Payment Method** â€” targeted offers and solutions could reduce loss.

## Tools Used
- R (tidymodels, vip, baguette, pdp, kernlab, yardstick )
- Models: MARS, Bagged Tree, Random Forest
- Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, ROC
- Business Presentation and Interpretation Report

## Deliverables
